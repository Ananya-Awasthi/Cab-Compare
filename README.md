<b> RideCompare – Smart Cab, Auto & Bike Fare Comparison</b>

Finding the best ride shouldn’t be guesswork. RideCompare helps users instantly compare estimated prices, ETAs, and ride types across popular providers like Uber, Ola, and Rapido — all through a clean, modern UI.

Whether you're planning a quick auto ride or booking a long-distance cab, RideCompare gives you clarity, convenience, and confidence before booking.

<b>Overview</b>

RideCompare is a lightweight, front-end comparison tool built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
It simulates real-world fare and ETA calculations using mock data and presents the results in a polished, user-friendly interface.

The project is designed as:

A portfolio-friendly web app,

A starter UI for integrating real APIs, and

A concept prototype for travel or mobility applications.
